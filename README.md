# Computer Vision Engineer Goals Tracker

This project is designed to track and visualize the goals and progress of a Computer Vision Engineer from February 2023 to December 2027. The application allows you to filter and update task statuses, keeping a clear overview of progress across multiple years.

## Features

- **Year Selection**: Filter tasks by year to see specific progress for each year.
- **Task Status Management**: Easily update the status of tasks (Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark modes for better visibility.
